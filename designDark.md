# Dark Mode Design Guide

This guide defines the **Dark Mode visual system** as an alternative to the existing Light Mode design.  
It ensures accessibility, visual harmony, and brand consistency while adapting your color palette to low-light environments.  

---

## 1. Typography

Typography remains consistent between Light and Dark modes for brand uniformity.  
Readability is maintained through color contrast rather than font changes.  

### Fonts & Usage
- **Headlines (Bold):** Bebas Neue Pro, SF Pro Display  
- **Conversational Headline (Medium):** SF Pro Display  
- **Body & Subhead (Regular/Light):** PP Editorial New, SF Pro Display  

### Font Weights Mapping
- Headline → **Bold**  
- Section Header → **Bold**  
- Subhead → **Regular**  
- Body → **Light/Regular**  
- Highlight → **Emphasis with color or bold weight**  

> ✅ **Tip:** Use color (e.g., Sunglow) or gradient highlights sparingly for emphasis.

## 2. Colors

Dark Mode introduces a **rich, muted base palette** with vibrant accents for emphasis.  
The goal is to avoid eye strain while keeping visual energy alive.  

### Primary Colors (Dark Mode)
- **Charcoal Black (#0D0D0D):**  
  Main background; conveys depth, focus, and modern sophistication.  

- **Onyx Gray (#1C1C1C):**  
  Secondary background; used for cards, containers, and layered sections.  

- **Platinum Gray (#E0E0E0):**  
  Primary text; ensures readability against dark backgrounds.  

- **Sunglow (#FDBA2F):**  
  Retained from Light Mode; used for energetic highlights, CTAs, and focus points.  

- **Electric Violet (#8C3BFF):**  
  Gradient partner for Sunglow; provides futuristic and cinematic vibrancy.  

- **Burnt Orange (#DB3B09):**  
  Secondary highlight tone (unchanged from Light Mode).  

---

### Usage Proportions
- **Charcoal Black** → 55% (primary background)  
- **Onyx Gray** → 20% (secondary surfaces/cards)  
- **Platinum Gray** → 15% (text, supporting UI)  
- **Sunglow** → 7% (buttons, accents, highlights)  
- **Gradient (Sunglow → Electric Violet)** → 3% (cinematic elements)  

> ✅ **Tip:** Avoid pure white (#FFFFFF). Use **Platinum Gray** instead for smoother, less harsh contrast.  

---

## 3. Logo Usage

- Use **light versions** of logos (white, Sunglow, or Gradient fill).  
- Ensure strong contrast against Charcoal/Onyx backgrounds.  
- Gradient logo treatments should use **Sunglow → Electric Violet**.  

---

## 4. Iconography

- **Default icons:** Platinum Gray (#E0E0E0).  
- **Active / Highlighted icons:** Sunglow (#FDBA2F) or Gradient overlay.  
- Maintain consistent line thickness and minimalism.  

---

## 5. Textures

Textures bring personality to Dark Mode without overwhelming it.  

Approved Textures:
- **Subtle Grid:** Low-opacity Platinum Gray for background depth.  
- **Gradient Overlays:** Sunglow → Violet, used sparingly for cinematic quality.  
- **Solid Dark Blocks:** Charcoal and Onyx for strong composition.  
- **Torn Paper / Paper:** Allowed but treated with muted tones.  

---

## 6. Best Practices & Notes

- Keep **contrast ratios** accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum).  
- Use **highlights sparingly** – Sunglow and gradients should *draw attention*, not dominate.  
- Provide a **toggle option** between Light and Dark modes for user choice.
