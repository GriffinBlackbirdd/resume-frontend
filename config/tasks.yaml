gap_analysis_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the given job description {jd} and resume {resume} in comprehensive detail to identify
    all required skills, qualifications, and competencies that are present, missing, or
    partially demonstrated. Create a structured gap analysis in tabular format with 5 columns:
    [JD Skill/Requirement, Present in Resume (Yes/No/Partial), Current Level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced if present),
    Gap Severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low), Gap Notes with specific improvement suggestions].
    Also assess the candidate's overall experience level for the target role (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
    to inform subsequent learning and project planning phases. Analyze both technical skills
    and soft skills from {jd}, consider transferable experience shown in {resume}, and prioritize gaps
    based on job criticality and market demand. Make sure the table is well-formatted in markdown
    for clarity and easy readability.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive markdown document containing: 1) Executive summary with overall candidate-job
    fit assessment between {resume} and {jd} with key findings, 2) Complete skill gap analysis table
    with all 5 required columns covering every skill mentioned in the {jd}, 3) Overall candidate
    experience level assessment for the target role based on {resume} analysis, 4) Prioritized list
    of critical gaps requiring immediate attention, 5) Summary of identified strengths and transferable
    skills from {resume}. The gap analysis table must be properly formatted in markdown with specific,
    actionable gap notes for each identified weakness and justified gap severity ratings based on
    job requirements from {jd} and industry standards.

upskilling_plan_task:
  description: >
    Based on the gap analysis results from comparing {resume} with {jd} and the candidate's assessed
    skill level (beginner, intermediate, or advanced), create two comprehensive actionable learning plans with
    extensive web research to find current, verified learning resources. Search the web
    using terms like '[skill] tutorial', '[skill] free course', '[skill] documentation',
    '[skill] learning path' for each identified skill gap. Create: 1) Immediate Plan (1-2 weeks)
    for quick wins and foundational concepts, 2) Long-Term Plan (15-30 days) for comprehensive
    skill development and mastery. Adapt content complexity based on candidate's current level from {resume} -
    for beginners focus on fundamentals and guided tutorials, for advanced learners provide
    specialized topics and best practices. Include specific time investments, progress milestones,
    hands-on exercises, and verify all resource links before inclusion. Ensure learning plans
    directly address the skills required in {jd} that are missing or weak in {resume}.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed structured markdown document with two comprehensive sections:
    ## Immediate Learning Plan (1-2 weeks) - For each priority skill gap identified between {resume} and {jd}:
    learning objectives and weekly milestones, daily time investment recommendations, specific resources formatted
    as "**Resource Name** - [Link](URL) - Description/Why recommended", hands-on exercises and
    practice activities, progress tracking methods and checkpoints.
    ## Long-term Learning Plan (15-30 days) - For comprehensive skill development to meet {jd} requirements:
    advanced learning objectives and monthly milestones, weekly time investment recommendations,
    progressive resource sequence with verified working links, real-world application projects
    and exercises, skill assessment and certification opportunities. All plans must be tailored
    to the candidate's assessed expertise level from {resume} with content complexity matching their current
    capabilities, and all resource links must be current, accessible, and properly formatted.

project_recommendation_task:
  description: >
    Research and recommend 5-8 diverse, practical, resume-worthy projects that are specifically
    aligned with the target job role from {jd} and demonstrate the missing skills identified in the gap
    analysis between {resume} and {jd}. Conduct extensive web research using targeted queries like
    '[job_role] projects', '[skill] project tutorial', 'github [technology] projects', 'awesome [technology] projects',
    '[role] portfolio projects' to find current project ideas, implementation tutorials, GitHub
    repositories, live demos, and comprehensive resources. These projects should help the candidate
    strengthen missing skills from the {resume} vs {jd} comparison, demonstrate applied expertise, and build an impressive portfolio.
    Ensure projects range from beginner to advanced difficulty levels, solve real-world problems
    relevant to the target industry mentioned in {jd}, and collectively cover all critical skills from the gap analysis.
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive markdown document with 5-8 detailed project recommendations, each containing:
    ## Project [N]: [Project Title] - Comprehensive project description and business problem solved,
    skills demonstrated/developed (specifically addressing gaps from {resume} vs {jd} analysis), difficulty level
    (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced) with justification, estimated completion timeline with weekly
    breakdown, complete technology stack and tools required, comprehensive implementation resources
    with verified working links formatted as "**Resource Type** - [Description](URL) - Why this
    resource helps" including: tutorial guides for step-by-step implementation, GitHub repositories
    with starter templates or similar projects, live demos and examples (if available), official
    documentation for technologies used, datasets or API references (if applicable), portfolio
    presentation guidance on how to showcase effectively, interview talking points for technical
    discussions. Include project sequencing recommendations and integration guidance with the
    learning plans to ensure optimal skill development progression toward meeting {jd} requirements.

team_leader_task:
  description: >
    Coordinate and synthesize all outputs from the gap analyst, upskilling planner, and project
    recommender into one unified, comprehensive career development report in markdown format that
    bridges the gap between {resume} and {jd}. Ensure consistency across all deliverables by reviewing
    skill level assessments, verifying that learning plans address identified gaps from {resume} vs {jd},
    confirming projects cover necessary skills to meet {jd} requirements, and validating all resource links
    are working and current. Create a cohesive narrative that logically flows from gap analysis to learning
    plans to project implementation, with clear connections between each phase. Provide executive summary,
    detailed analysis integration, implementation timeline with priority matrix, and actionable next steps
    for immediate and long-term career advancement toward the target role in {jd}.
  expected_output: >
